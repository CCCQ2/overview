# How the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console works
{: #bluemixoverviewui}

When you access the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, the menu bar displays links or buttons to sign up, log in, access documentation, and access the catalog. After you log in, the menu bar contains a Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) and additional links, depending on your account type.

## Using the console
{: #consoleoptions}

The following options are available from the menu bar:

* If you are a new {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} user, you can use the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) to switch between the Apps, Services, and Infrastructure dashboards. You can use the **Catalog** link to access platform and infrastructure services. Links to support and account, billing and usage, and security management options are also displayed.
* If you are an existing user with a {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account, you can use the Menu icon ![Menu icon icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) to switch between the Apps and Services dashboards. You can use the **Catalog** link to access platform and infrastructure services, and links to platform-level support and account, billing and usage, and security management options are displayed.
* If you are an existing user and you have linked your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and your {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} account, you can use the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) to switch between the Apps, Services, and Infrastructure dashboards. You can also use the **Catalog** link to access platform and infrastructure services.
  * When you're in the Apps and Services dashboards, the menu bar includes links to platform-level resources, such as {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} documentation, support, and account and security management options. You can also access links to infrastructure-level billing options.
  * When you're in the Infrastrcuture dashboard, the menu bar displays links to infrastructure-level resources, such as KnowledgeLayer help, contact options, notifications, open tickets, and support and account management options.
* If you are an existing user with a {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} account that isn't linked to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you can use the Menu icon ![Menu icon](../icons/icon_hamburger.svg) to access the Infrastructure dashboard and the **Catalog** link to access infrastructure services. The menu bar also includes links to KnowledgeLayer help, contact options, notifications, open tickets, and support and account options.

## Switching regions 
{: #regionselector}

When you use the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} console, you are automatically shown the information for the nearest healthy geographical region. Global load balancing for the console ensures that if for some reason the nearest geographical region for you is down, your console displays the information for the next closest region. This way, you always have access to the console without having to take any action to access the information you need.

Use the region selector in the console to filter your view. For example, if you are accessing your apps and services in your Dallas, US region, but you want to view your apps and services for the London region, you can use the region selector to change your view:

1. Click the user account preferences link.
2. Expand the **Region** menu.
3. Select the region you require from the list.

Filtering your view per region also enables you to quickly switch views to work with orgs, spaces, and users assigned to the different regions.

If you want to learn more about regions and how to connect to a specific region by using the CLI, see [Regions](/docs/overview/cf.html#ov_intro_reg).
